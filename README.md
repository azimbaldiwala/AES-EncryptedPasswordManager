# AES-EncryptedPasswordManager

This code is divided into 3 files 

### AES.py 
AES.py is used to encrypt and decrypt the message using a key.

### app.py 
app.py is a user-interface.

### database.py
database.py is database connection and performs database related tasks 

### This script asks user to login and then asks for a key to encrypt or decrypt the password, It also has fewe more features show on user-interface, I just wanted to implement AES so i have not made any GUI, you can make a GUI based app and still use the same database.py and AES.py
